## Hi there! 👋
My name is Aashrey Jain and I am a Backend Developer!  
As a software developer at Oracle, I was a member of the DBaaS (Database as a Service) team and was involved in the complete life-cycle management of the service.  

With my team, I was responsible for using the Python SDK for OCI and applying Infrastructure-as-Code principles to perform the end-to-end automation of provisioning the underlying cloud infrastructure, as well as configuration and networking management for it, to support the requirements of Oracle’s cloud database customers.

I am currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science and Information Security (CSIS) from IIIT, Hyderabad.
